# Metrics collection and reporting

`rudder` enabled metrics collection via `--metrics` flag. A metrics server can be enabled (by `--metrics.addr` and `--metrics.port`). The metrics are served in two formats:

- `/debug/metrics`: json representation of expvars and go-metrics
- `/debug/metrics/prometheus`: same metrics as above but in prometheus format

Monitoring can be setup (for example) by plugging the endpoint serving in prometheus-format into influxdb, which is plugged into grafana.
